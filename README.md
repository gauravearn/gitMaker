# gitMaker
A ruby class that will do all the tasks for the git initialize, commit, push, generating the git tokens and committing to specific branches. A gitmaker class which will inititalize the git, commit to the git,push to the git, branch to the git, generate the rsa pub files for the git account and you  dont have to remember, simply install the class and then invokve it from anywhere.

I am doing some final changes and pushing a bigger gem so that you can even do more out it.
